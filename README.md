# Weather-Ridership-Chicago

In this project, I analyzed passenger data (bus and train) and weather data for the city of Chicago to understand how weather conditions can impact the number of passengers and to create a machine learning model that predicts whether the transportation of the day will be crowded or not based on the weather conditions.

This can help the citizens of Chicago avoid crowds if they wish.
